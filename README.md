# Hacienda Maps
[Hacienda](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19100/hacienda) is a boardgame by Wolfgang Kramer.  It can be played on [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en) with custom maps.  These maps are custom crafted and available for your repeated exploration, if you enjoy the unique challenge any one presents.

Look at each map and you can get a sense of the preferred player count.  Just ask, if this were played with `n` players would I feel okay if I were going last?  In the more symmetrical maps it's usually more of a question of whether the player count should be even rather than odd.  Use your judgment.

In each map I explored different ideas.  I won't attempt to explain each since discovery is part of the fun, but suffice to say, a few plays will give you a sense of what its challenges are and whether one needs an unusual strategy.  In some instances the tile may offer a clue.

In Peas & Carrots, as an example, and since most maps use heterogeneous areas, I wanted to explore the difficulty of building a position among homogeneous patches of terrain.

In some of my earlier maps (i.e. Fjords) I made the pampas channels too narrow making the placement of watering holes difficult.  The maps still work but they offer a different kind of play.  In later maps, I expanded the pampas areas to make them useful again.
